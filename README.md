# YRDSB Mark Fetcher & Teaching Assistant AI

This repository contains a Flask-based web application designed to help students fetch their marks from the YRDSB portal, view detailed assignment reports, and interact with an AI-powered teaching assistant.

## Overview

The application provides the following functionalities:
- **Fetch Marks:** Log in with your YRDSB credentials to retrieve current and midterm marks for your courses.
- **Advanced Reports:** View a detailed breakdown of assignment marks across various categories such as Knowledge, Thinking, Communication, Application, and Culminating.
- **AI Chat Assistant:** Engage in a chat with an AI teaching assistant that can answer questions and offer guidance based on your mark data, using Googleâ€™s GenAI services.

## Features

- **User Authentication & Session Management:**  
  Uses Flask sessions to store user information temporarily during the session.
  
- **Data Parsing:**  
  Utilizes `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape and parse HTML from the YRDSB website for marks and assignment reports.

- **Local Data Storage:**  
  Stores fetched data in a JSON file (`user_marks.json`)

- **AI Integration:**  
  Incorporates Google GenAI to create an interactive chat experience, providing responses based on user input and fetched data.
